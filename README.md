<h1>What this should be</h1>

Hello everybody!
I am a (at the point of starting all this) 16 year old German boy with many interests and achievements.
In this github repository I just want to collect and safely store all the things I think are worth to be
shown off and may be interesting or helpful for some other person on the planet :).

The stuff you'll find in here will vary but mostly being insane realizations about life, my views on some
things, why people are who they are, nerdy sience stuff and my coding projects and still so much more.
The texts I'll write will originally be written in German (because I can articulate myself way more accurately then)
but I'll also always provide a google translated file in English.

A part of the motivation for writing all of this down (I know Github may not seem like the greatest choice
but I like it here) and make it publicly available is the fact that (without already diving too
deep into one of the topics), if I die I feel like there are so many great things I found out and got behind
during my lifetime (already), all of which would basically vanish and just disappear because I just found them
out for myself and never shared anything or wrote them down. I feel like way more people should be confronted with these ideas at least once since they are (were for me) so game-/lifechanging. Also all these things which may help or inspire
someone and completely change his life and perspectives on things as it did for me would just be gone (until someone else figures all of this out themselves. But if they'll share it.. unlikely I'd say). Furthermore in the far future I maybe want to write a
book about this though that's long not decided.

So go on! If you want to read what nobody else tells you about life and experience life-changing
discoveries yourself, you're at the right place!


(P.s.: I really don't think anyone will ever read this lol. But if so: Sorry for my English sometimes. I
am as already stated German and although my English is quite good, there may still be some situations
that just sound wierd to the native speaker)
