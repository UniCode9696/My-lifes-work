In this file you'll find all my coding (and maybe other) project ideas I thought of and am working, have worked or want to work on some day.


Current:
- M.E. (MyEngine; Ui and stuff)


Delayed:
- 3D engine (Raytracing)
- Networking


Future:
- 2D Portal game; Sideview; Skillbased; (Portal-gun, grappler, slow-Mo, etc.)
- 2D Robbing game; Topdown; (Inspired by this mobile 'robs robbery' or so)
- 2D Changing maze game; Topdown;
- 2D Industry factory building game; (Inspired by 'Assembly Line')
- 2D Aufbau game; Open world; (Inspired by 'Stardew Valley' / 'Minecraft')
- 3D Space exploring game; Base building;
Explore planets for resources; Open world; (Inspired by 'Deep Rock Galactic')
- 3D Voxelart style game

- In Greenfoot 3D Engine (+ raytracing?)
- Raycasting 3D (Like 'Doom')
- Circuit simulator (Editor + Run); Be able to build a working computer (Look at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW9N6kGbu2I)
- Life and evolution simulations
- Nice physics engine (Colliders of all sorts, particles, ...)
- Particle simulations


Stopped:
- Chess game
- Neural network


Finished:
- 2D Lighting engine
- Scalable TikTakToe game
